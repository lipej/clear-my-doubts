# ClearMyDoubts

ClearMyDoubts is an AI chat app that uses web socket technology to keep a continuous connection to the server. This allows real-time, two-way communication between the user and the server, ensuring immediate message delivery and quick AI responses.
A standout feature of this app is its voice recognition capabilities. Users can speak directly into their device and the app will transcribe the speech into text. This not only improves accessibility but also enables users to multitask, making the app more convenient and efficient.
